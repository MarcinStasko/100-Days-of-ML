# 100-Days-of-ML


## Day 1 (25-03-20) : Binary Classification
- Implement a Deep Neural Network for Classification of Cats and Dogs.
- Tweaked the model by feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.
- Minimized overfitting by adding image augmentation through Image Data Generator.
-Achieved an accuracy of 90 percent without using any dense layers.
